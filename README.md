# Simple Shell Project

This is a simple shell project, which is a command-line interpreter that allows users to execute commands by typing them manually in the terminal. The project is written in C programming language and was developed by Houssam Mrabet and Mahmoud Khairi as a group project for ALX SE.

## How to Run the Simple Shell

To run the simple shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/simple_shell.git
```

2. Compile the program using the following command:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```

3. Run the program using the following command:
```
./hsh
```

Once the program is running, you can type commands and the shell will execute them. You can exit the shell by typing `exit` or pressing `ctrl + d`.

## Features of the Simple Shell

The simple shell supports the following features:

- Executing commands with arguments
- Handling multiple commands separated by `;`
- Handling input and output redirection with `<` and `>`
- Handling pipes with `|`
- Running commands in the background with `&`
